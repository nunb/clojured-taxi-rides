# clojured-taxi-rides

This repository will contain an application that will be used to test and improve my Clojure bridge for Apache Flink. 
It is heavily inspired by the Apacha Flink training available at http://dataartisans.github.io/flink-training/

## Current status

Execution will **fail**! Please have some patience!

## Installation

1) Download the **Taxi Data Stream** from http://dataartisans.github.io/flink-training/trainingData/nycTaxiRides.gz
2) Create the following direcotry (if not already exist): <PROJECT_ROOT>/resources/datasets
3) Copy the downloaded .gz file into this directory
4) Download **clojure2flink** ... *(work in progress!)*

Clojure: 1.8.0
Java: 1.8.0_101
